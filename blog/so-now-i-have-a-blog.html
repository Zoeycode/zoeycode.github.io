I don’t really have any plans to post here regularly, but idk maybe that’ll change in the future.</p> <p>That’s pretty much it as far as the non-technical side of things goes.</p> <h2>The Technical Side of Things</h2> <p>I haven’t really written anything about how my site works before, so this is also going to contain some general information about the site as a whole.</p> <p><code>zyl.gay</code> is a static website built with a custom static site builder I built for it. It started by taking Markdown pages and rendering them on top of the appropriate template.</p> <p>When I added the <a href="/images/">images section</a> to the site I added the first abstraction on top of this: YAML files with the relevant metadata for the image (including a short but unstyled description) which then get rendered not only into pages for the individual pages, but also a paginated display for all the images <em>and</em> a method to view images by tag.</p> <p>To get blogs working I modified the image page code to be generic over provided resource types, so really the images and the blog posts are rendered the same way, just with different configurations.</p> </div> <hr /> <h3 class="tags-title">Tags</h3> <div class="post-tags"> <a class="tag" href="/blog/tag/meta">meta</a>, <a class="tag" href="/blog/tag/technical">technical</a> </div> </div> </main>
