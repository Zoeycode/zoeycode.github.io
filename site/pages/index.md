# not zoey's website

Welcome! I'm (not) zoey, a trans woman\* located in the Pacific Northwest.

There's not much here, so here are some other places I'm at sometimes:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/zyllian)
- [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@zyllian) (Mostly short video game clips and my cat)
- [Mastodon](https://mas.to/@zyl)
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/zylllian)

I also have accounts over at these places but haven't posted much:

- [cohost](https://cohost.org/zyl)
- [tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/zyllian)

\*my gender's absolutely fucked. woman is an approximation
