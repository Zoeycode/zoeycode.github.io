# Zoey's Website

Welcome! I'm Zoey (not really), a trans woman in the <abbr title="Pacific Northwest">PNW</abbr>.

There's not much here, so here are some other places I'm at sometimes:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/Zyllian)
- [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@zyllian) (Mostly short video game clips and my cat)
- [Mastodon](https://mas.to/@zyl)
- [cohost](https://cohost.org/zyl)
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Zylllian) (Probably won't be posting here anytime soon)
