I thought it might be useful to write out my experiences with the four methods of taking estradiol I've tried.

- patches
  - wouldn't consistently stay on me
  - could feel the effects wearing off 3-4 days after application
  - insurance sucks
- sublingual pills
  - worked alright, except:
  - could feel them wearing off ~5-6 hours after taking a dose
  - apparently hard to measure levels? had one test at ~200 mg/ml and another at 400+ mg/ml at same dosage
- swallowed pills
  - could not get ideal levels with a reasonable number of pills, but:
  - couldn't actually feel them wearing off even at 12 hours between doses
- injections
  - holy shit these are great
  - was kinda nervous the first few times I injected myself, but I got used to it
  - cannot feel it wearing off between doses
  - levels are actually good??
  - insurance sucks pt. 2
