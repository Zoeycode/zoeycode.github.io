# [webdog.](https://webdog.zyl.gay)

if you've been to my site recently, you may have noticed the "powered by webdog" text in the footer. if not, then surprise! i've been upgrading the tool i wrote to build this site to make it more general (i.e. NOT coupled explicitly to my own website) and more easily available for anyone to use.

if this post is out of drafts by the time you read this, it should be ready to be installed like so (if you have rust installed):

```sh
cargo install webdog
```

and that's it! now you can use webdog to build a site of your own! the [webdog site](https://webdog.zyl.gay) has more information on how to use it, but i'll write some stuff up here too at some point.
