had the house to myself to try out some outfits and makeup without any external pressure

this picture's of my first time applying any makeup where despite thinking it all looked like shit individually, I think all the parts came together well

I'm wearing only lipstick, a little blush, and eyeliner. the foundation in the kit I was given wouldn't stay on ðŸ¤·
